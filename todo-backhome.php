                	<li>Learn driving.
	                <li>Learn to cook- Don't learn the desi way of one day before leaving. 
	                <li>Put some effort &amp; practice for maybe a week. It might be well 
	                worth the effort. You just need to have a feel for it. effort 
	                and practice help only to an extent once you get the feel, it 
	                is all quite easy even easier if you have lots of instant stuff 
	                on hand.
	                <li>Make outstation purchases (sweater, thermal underwear, cassettes, 
	                etc. - available/cheap in Delhi, Bombay).
	                <li>Get medical checkup done.
	                <li>Dental - A must...Health insurance in this country does not cover 
	                dental problems and is really costly...go early to the dentist...it 
	                takes time to recuperate, in case u need some surgery or something 
	                <li>Fresh checkup, especially if you have a major ailment 
	                <li>Get prescriptions &amp; medicines for all common ailments (the 
	                technical name of the medicine along with Indian/US brand name).

	                <li>Take vaccination for MMR. Its a 2 dose vaccine to be taken at 
	                an interval of one month from the 1st to 2nd. If u don't take 
	                it in desh its going to cost a lot in US. Also take tetanus. Paranoid 
	                characters can take Rabies, yellow fever, malaria, hepatits A,B,C..Z 
	                vaccines :-)
	                <li>Some universities just need a doctor's signature on a sheet 
	                of paper the university provides...the doctor might insist that 
	                u take the injection...it is a good idea to take MMR and tetanus 
	                in any case... And don&#8217;t forget to get the medical form. 
	                It applies to UB and it should be in your application packet. 
	                
	                <li>Get cassettes recorded which you may like to take with you - Lots 
	                of them. No point taking western music casettes. CD's are cheap 
	                in the US. So stick to Carnatic &amp; light music.

	                showing that your place of residence falls in the jurisdiction 
	                of that passport office (It might take some time, and pain). ECNR

	                TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS</strong></font></p>
	              <p align="justify">The next thing to 
	                do is blocking tickets (this implies no financial commitment). 
	                This can be done via travel agents. Make sure the Travel Agent 
	                is good (examples of dependable travel agents are -Travel Corporation 
	                of India (TCI), Thomas cook, etc). </font></p>
	              <p align="justify">Block flights with 
	                many airlines/agencies. Put pressure on the agencies and get as 
	                much info as possible. Much before the flight call the airlines 
	                themselves and confirm your ticket.<br>
	                <br>
	                Indicate whether you want Asian Vegetarian Meal (AVM), non-smoking 
	                section, etc </font></p>
	              <p align="justify">Cross-check everything 
	                the travel agent says. <br>
	                Some airlines offer Frequent Flier programs (e.g. Air France, 
	                TWA) [i.e. after a certain number of miles of flying with that 
	                airline you get a free ticket]. Enroll in such programs as you 
	                might again travel to and from India. </font></p>
	              <p align="justify">Avoid change of airline. 
	                A direct flight is the best. If change of airline can't be avoided, 
	                leave at least 4-6 hrs gap between the scheduled arrival of one 
	                flight and the scheduled departure of the connecting flight. </font></p>
	              <p align="justify">Baggage is usually 
	                safe with a single airline - change of airline sometimes leads 
	                to misplaced luggage. Some airlines don't take care of baggage 
	                transfer - you may have to personally carry it (check this while 
	                booking). Ensure if the baggage will be taken care of at every 
	                stop over.<br>
