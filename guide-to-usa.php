	              <p><strong><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction </strong><br> 
	                Usually, before anyone comes to the U.S.A for the first time from 
	                India he/she will start talking to people who have been here before 
	                and get information from them about what to expect, what to do 
	                etc. Though this gives some idea, it doesn't make one confident 
	                or better prepared. </font></p> 
	              <p>So we felt the need for a small, 
	                informal document which anyone could carry along with or read 
	                on the plane before he/she gets to the U.S.A. The objective of 
	                this document is to make you aware of things, situations to expect 
	                and enlighten you with facts so that you can be comfortable once 
	                you get here. </font></p> 
	              <p>You will be better prepared for the 
	                trip if you read this document before going or just after reaching. 
	                It tries to give information on preparing for the trip, food, 
	                travel, stay and culture in the U.S. </font></p> 
	              <p>This is just out of our experience 
	                and rather than authoritative statements, which may be arguable. 
	                We want you to enjoy your trip to the U.S. and your stay as much 
	                as possible. </font></p> 
	              <p>All the best !! :) </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="carryluggage"></a>Carry Luggage</strong> <br> 
	                The carry baggage is one big problem while coming to U.S. What 
	                to carry? How much to carry? Do I carry more woolen clothes because 
	                its cold out there? </font></p> 
	              <p>Don't carry too many heavy utensils, 
	                cooker etc. You can buy most of the utensils there. They are not 
	                costly and you don't have to carry much. You can carry some spices 
	                with you if you want to, because after coming here you may start 
	                missing the Indian food taste. </font></p> 
	              <p>Don't carry too many warm clothes 
	                (unless you are coming in winter), or sports shoes etc. It would 
	                be better if you buy them after here. You should carry leather 
	                shoes from India, since leather items are costly in the U.S. Rest, 
	                it all depends on you and your needs !! </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="transit"></a>Transit</strong><br> 
	                Enjoy your flight. Try to learn more about other nations from 
	                the co-passengers. There can be international stops on your way 
	                to the U.S. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong>International Stops<br> 
	                </strong></font>Generally passengers 
	                are required to get down at an International stop, which might 
	                be for Security checkup or fueling / cleaning of the airplane. 
	                You will be given a 'transit card` or say 'transit visa`. Normally 
	                the halt is for a couple of hours. Listen to the announcement 
	                which is always made before the international halt. You will hear 
	                information about departure time, gate number etc. After getting 
	                down at International Airport, you can move around in the airport. 
	                Be at the gate within 45 minutes of your flight's departure for 
	                the onward journey, because they may require to check your tickets 
	                or even the gate might be changed at the last moment. Once you 
	                get in, you are all set to take off for the final destination. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p><strong>Immigration <br> 
	                </strong></font>The first thing you 
	                need to go through at the port-of-entry U.S. airport (international 
	                airport where you first land in the U.S.), after landing is the 
	                immigration and customs clearance. After that you may board a 
	                domestic flight to reach your final destination. Before getting 
	                down at your port-of-entry final international halt, inside the 
	                plane, you will be given a form to fill up called I-94. You will 
	                have to fill that up carefully. Feel free to get help from the 
	                flight crew. They will also ask you to fill you a 'declaration 
	                form' asking you about what objectionable items you have in your 
	                baggage (there will be a checklist).</font></p> 
	              <p>On alighting from the plane you may 
	                ask people or signs will guide you to the immigration. Keep your 
	                passport, I-20 and the form you filled inside the plane, handy. 
	                At the counter you might be asked some questions. TALK ABSOLUTELY 
	                TO THE POINT. DON'T TRY TO LIE. MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU SAY 
	                IS WRITTEN ON THE PAPER. You will be given the counter foil of 
	                I-94 form. Keep that very carefully. It may / may not be stapled 
	                to your passport. </font></p>  
	              <p><strong>Baggage Claim<br> 
	                </strong></font>Try to acquire some 
	                25 cent coins (called "quarters"), which you may need 
	                for getting a trolley cart for your baggage (a dollar bill may 
	                also do) and also for making telephone calls etc. Thereafter move 
	                toward the baggage claim carousel assigned to your flight, simply 
	                follow the signs directing you to the place. Collect your luggage 
	                and look for signs directing you to customs clearance. At the 
	                customs clearance they may ask you to open your bags for a security 
	                check/verification. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong>Domestic Flight<br> 
	                </strong></font>Since the Port-of-entry 
	                may not be your final destination in the U.S. and you may have 
	                to proceed onwards, locate the counter for the domestic airline 
	                you will be taking to your final destination. Above all don't 
	                hesitate or feel shy to ask for help from airport support staff 
	                (at information desks) or police officers, if you need anything. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p>Follow signs directing you to your 
	                domestic flight because you will need a boarding pass. If it is 
	                far away, take the Airport shuttle (bus) service which is free. 
	                If you don't know where to get down, tell the driver in advance 
	                and he will drop you off at the proper place. At the counter (podium) 
	                check-in your baggage and get your boarding pass issued and ready. 
	                On arrival at the final destination, collect your baggage once 
	                again and look around for that someone who may be there to receive 
	                you. Finally, if no one comes to pick you up, try to locate the 
	                information counter from where you will get all the information 
	                regarding how to call. Also the Public Transport section of this 
	                guide will help you in understanding the travel facilities available 
	                in the U.S. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="usingtelephones"></a>Using Telephones </font></strong><br> 
	                The first thing you might do when you come to U.S.A. is call someone. 
	                So this is a good time to tell you about telephone usage. Telephone 
	                calls within U.S. are considered "local" (within the 
	                area of the caller) or "long distance" (outside the 
	                area of the caller). Local calls within a short region are free 
	                unless made from a public pay phone which is a coin operated machine. 
	                Long distance calls are charged at varying rates, depending on 
	                how you make the call (which long distance carrier/company you 
	                use), for how long you speak and the time of the day. Note that 
	                the telephone companies in the U.S. are private. Each local region 
	                is assigned an "area code". So the phone numbers are 
	                denoted as (area code)-123 4567. where 123-4567 is your actual 
	                phone number. If you are calling a number within your "area" 
	                then you should dial only the phone number. If the call is outside 
	                your area you need to dial 1-(area code)-123-4567, which is the 
	                long distance call. </font></p> 
	              <p>To make an international call i.e. 
	                to India you need to dial 011-91-&lt;STD CODE -&lt;TEL. NO. e.g. 
	                011-91-22-1234567. Here 011 indicates an international call. 91 
	                is the country code for India. 22 is the "area code" 
	                for Bombay and 1234567 may be the actual phone number you want 
	                to dial. </font></p> 
	              <p>Other important facilities provided 
	                are - </font></p> 
	              <p>1. Yellow pages (Telephone directory) 
	                <br> 
	                2. Emergency Telephone Number <br> 
	                There is one emergency number that you can dial for any type of 
	                emergency <br> 
	                which is 911 (Fire/Ambulance/Police). <br> 
	                3. Directory assistance <br> 
	                Local telephone numbers - 411 <br> 
	                Long distance - 1-(Area Code)-555-1212 <br> 
	                Toll Free number enquiry - 1-800-555-1212 <br> 
	                4. Toll free numbers<br> 
	                Most of the 1-800 numbers are toll free. You will not be charged 
	                for the calls you make to such numbers. e.g. The toll free number 
	                for Mr. Sriram Raghavan (DCI California) is 1-800-969-1117. This 
	                is a toll free number and you can dial it from anywhere in the 
	                U.S. without having to pay for it, even from a public phone. Some 
	                telephone numbers have alphabets in them such as 1-800-COLLECT. 
	                To dial this number, just press the digit on the telephone pad 
	                which has the corresponding alphabet you want to dial on it, simple!. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p>Most people use answering machines 
	                which are connected to their telephones, or some kind of voice 
	                mail system. It has a standard pre-recorded greeting which is 
	                played when you call up and then after some beeps, it records 
	                your message. Initially you will feel like you were talking to 
	                a dead person, but soon you realize theimportance of owning an 
	                answering machine. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong>Using the public "pay" 
	                phones </strong><br> 
	                The important difference is, you need to insert the money first 
	                then dial the number. To operate a pay phone you need 25 cents. 
	                This pays for one local call. If your call is not connected your 
	                money is returned in the "coin return" slot.</font>Collect 
	                call - If you want the called party (person whom you are calling) 
	                to pay for the call then you make a collect call. To make a collect 
	                call pick up the receiver and press 0. Let the operator know that 
	                you want to make a COLLECT call, the operator will connect you 
	                to the phone number you need. But before that the operator will 
	                check with the other party if they want to collect (pay for) the 
	                call. An easier way is to dial 1800-COLLECT from any phone and 
	                just follow the recorded instructions. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="tzandcurr"></a>Time Zones and Currency</strong></p> 
	              <p><strong>Time zone:</strong></p> 
	             There are four time zones in the 
	                U.S. <br> 
	                1) Eastern TZ <br> 
	                Example : Massachusetts, New York, Florida etc. </font></p> 
	              <p>2) Central TZ ( lags Eastern TZ by 
	                one hour ) <br> 
	                Example : Iowa, Kentucky, Indiana etc. </font></p> 
	              <p>3) Mountain TZ ( lags Eastern TZ 
	                by two hours ) <br> 
	                Example : Colorado, Utah, Wyoming etc.</font>4) 
	                <p>4) Pacific TZ ( lags Eastern TZ by three hours ) <br> 
	                Example : California, Oregon, Washington etc. </font></p> 
	              <p> <strong>Day light saving</font></strong></p> 
	              As the name suggests, the time is 
	                set in such a way that maximum day light could be used. e.g. During 
	                summer, the sun rises at around 4-5 o'clock. So the clock is set 
	                forward by one hour. This forces all activities to start one hour 
	                earlier so that maximum day light is used till late in the evening.

	              W. Bush signed the <em>Energy Policy Act of 2005</em>. This Act
	              changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the U.S.

	                All major cities have some sort of public transportation not necessarily 
	                very good or frequent or well connected. Therefore most people 
	                prefer to travel by their own cars. It is better that you own 
	                a car in the U.S. so that you are independent. But until you get 
	                to buy a car you can use the public transportation system or depend 
	                on your friends/colleagues for a ride. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong>Trains and Buses </strong></font></p> 
	              In most cities, you may purchase 
	                Daily Tickets from the conductor or the driver on the train and 
	                buses each day. For more information on routes, schedules and 
	                fares, see the publications and maps published by the city's local 
	                authority. You can locate them in your telephone book. For Buffalo,

	              In some areas you must telephone 
	                for a taxi and make an appointment. You will not find them waiting 
	                in the street corners but you do find them waiting in a queue 
	                at the airport. Taxis are listed in the yellow pages under the 
	                name "Taxi" or "Taxicabs". </font></p> 
	              <p>When you call, tell the "dispatch" 
	                operator where you are and where you want to go. The dispatch 
	                operator will tell you how long it will take for the taxi to arrive 
	                at your starting point. He or she may ask for the telephone number, 
	                so they can call you if the taxi driver cannot locate you. You 
	                should ask for the estimated cost of the ride. </font></p> 
	              <p>When you enter the taxi, the meter 
	                will read flat rate. This is the minimum charge. Then you will 
	                be charged on a per mile basis. </font></p>

	                For successful conversation, in the US, it is advisable that you 
	                speak slowly and pronounce properly. Well, the first part you 
	                really need to practice otherwise what you will hear from the 
	                person opposite is "pardon me", "come again", 
	                "I am sorry", "I didn't get you". The changes 
	                in pronunciation are like 'schedule' pronounced as 'skedule', 
	                'route' pronounced 'raut' etc. Also some words are totally substituted 
	                like 'petrol' by 'gas'. Here is a table from Gary Nobel of HP 
	                San Diego, which he created when he traveled in India. Thanks 
	                to him. The dictionary is very remarkable. </font></p>

	              <p>This is just to make you get a hang

	                Of course you must be hungry, when you arrive. God knows what 
	                you ate on the plane. You don't remember the item's name or its 
	                contents. It may be one of the weirdest things you ever had for 
	                dinner or lunch. So you must be apprehensive about what you will 
	                get for lunch or dinner. The best thing you can try is PIZZA, 
	                which is pronounced as "PiTza". </font></p> 
	              <p>You get both Veg. and Non-Veg Pizzas. 
	                Order a small pizza if you are alone or a medium size is enough 
	                for two or three (well it depends on your appetite actually). 
	                You can order pizza by phone and it will be delivered at your 
	                doorstep in a few minutes. Refer to the yellow pages or consult 
	                the motel receptionist you are staying in, for information. </font></p> 
	              <p>For breakfast, have 'Continental 
	                breakfast' which is cheap and the best. To be sure about Veg. 
	                items, always ask for items with "NO MEAT" rather than 
	                "WITHOUT MEAT". Be sure to say "NO ICE" if 
	                you prefer to have your drink without ice. And remember that a 
	                CHEESEBURGER is a misnomer. It contains meat besides cheese, so

	              <p>- Project Leaders are very understanding

	                - There is a lot of individualistic approach. Every person's inputs

	              <p>- They dress casually and nobody 
	                bothers which dress you wear etc. </font></p> 
	              <p>- They are fun loving people and 
	                enjoy their free time. Most of them like to keep themselves physically 
	                fit by regular outings, hiking, exercise, biking, jogging etc. 
	                They love the outdoors and natural surroundings. They look forward 
	                to weekends and plan their weekend activities in advance. This 
	                usually consists of some outdoor activity. </font></p> 
	              <p>- They are frank about their opinions. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p>- They respect individual views and 
	                allow everyone to voice their own ideas on a subject. </font></p> 
	              <p>- They have a lot of patience. Especially 
	                when standing in queues or while driving, nobody will try to jump 
	                before you in the queue. Most of them are very disciplined drivers. 
	                However this differs from State to State. </font></p> 
	              <p>- If they happen to come in your 
	                way or you happen to come in their way, you will promptly hear 
	                an "Excuse me" or "Excuse us". </font></p> 
	              <p>- They need a lot of feedback while 
	                talking. You have to acknowledge/nod continuously. Otherwise they 
	                feel you are not interested in listening or are confused. </font></p> 
	              <p>- They gesture a lot and shoot some 
	                funny (at least so it seems initially) phrases at you. It is a 
	                matter of "getting used to it". </font>- 
	                They are "very" proud of their country. To them, the 
	                Universe is the United States. So never ever make fun of or speak 
	                lightly about them or tell them that they do not have any social/cultural 
	                background. You will make more American friends that way. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Most Americans think of India as 
	                a poor country of beggars, snake charmers and swamis etc. This 
	                is due to the insufficient and improper media coverage given to 
	                India. Their T.V. only shows only the poor Indian villages and 
	                cows on the streets. </font></p> 
	              <p>Hope you will be able to prove that 
	                India is a country of INTELLIGENT people like you and not just 
	                ELEPHANTS and SNAKE CHARMERS. <br> 
	                Social Security and Driving License <br> 
	                You must go and get your social security number and driving license 
	                done immediately after you come. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="ssn"></a>Social Security Number </strong></font></p> 
	              Each individual in Unites States, 
	                is required to be registered with US government by law. This is 
	                similar to the registration in India through Ration Card. </font></p> 
	              <p>Government can keep track of the 
	                individual from this particular number. You will need the SS number 
	                for any official paper work or dealings e.g. while filling Tax 
	                forms or while opening a bank account or while getting a membership 
	                in the public library. A person's entire credit history can be 
	                traced from this number. As soon as one arrives in US he/she is 
	                required to get Social Security number immediately. It is a very 
	                simple procedure. Most universities will have this as apart of 
	                the International student orientation program. </font></p> 
	              <p>Every town or a city has a Social 
	                Security office. You have to go there with your Passport. First 
	                thing you need to do is collect the application form for new social 
	                security number. These forms are available in various languages. 
	                Find one in English and fill it completely. It will ask you for 
	                your local postal address details besides other information. The 
	                officer will check your application form and passport. After checking 
	                everything you will be informed when you will be receiving your 
	                Social Security number, which will be by postal mail. </font></p> 
	              <p>Generally within three to four weeks 
	                time you will receive your social security number which appears 
	                printed on a small card, which you should preserve safely.<br>

	                </font><strong>Getting Driver's License</strong> 
	                </font></p> 
	              Driver's license is one of the most 
	                important documents required in United States. Apart from driving 
	                needs it is required at almost all the places where you need to 
	                show your ID. Mainly because this is the only valid Identity card 
	                which is required and approved at all the places. </font></p> 
	              <p>Here in US most of the money transactions 
	                are done via checks or Credit-cards. Initially when you don't 
	                have credit card, check is the only practical and recommended 
	                way of payment. Nobody keeps cash. People generally issue checks 
	                even for a small amount of less than $5.00. Checks are as good 
	                as Cash and can be deposited at any ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) 
	                center. These checks are accepted only with a valid PHOTO-ID at 
	                most places. Actually a Photo-id could also be a simple identity 
	                card issued by the DMV (Dept. of motor vehicles), which is not 
	                a driver's license. At most places Driver's license is the only 
	                valid PHOTO-ID. So after getting Social Security number, Driver's 
	                license is another very important thing one should acquire as 
	                soon as possible. <br> 
	                Getting driver's license is not very difficult here. Before appearing 
	                for a driving test behind the wheels one has to clear a written 
	                test conducted by DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles - similar 
	                to RTO in India). Each state has its own laws for driving a vehicle. 
	                DMV issues a book on the rules which are required to be followed 
	                very strictly. This book gives detailed information about all 
	                the laws and is written in a very nice manner. It is very easy 
	                to follow all the rules as they are nicely explained and if necessary, 
	                supported by good photographs. </font></p> 
	              <p>After understanding the contents 
	                of this book you can appear for the written exam. You can appear 
	                for the test on any working day. You can call up DMV and take 
	                an appointment with them or you can even go directly. </font></p> 
	              <p>They will check your Passport and 
	                will give you a question paper. Questions are objective type and 
	                you have to choose the best answer for each question. Time is 
	                no limit for the exam. After you are done with it, the person 
	                on the counter will immediately check your paper and will tell 
	                you your score. Upon passing this test you will get temporary 
	                driving license which is valid for two months. DMV also issues 
	                an ID card. This is issued by the state government. You can use 
	                this Id card as a Photo-Id till you get your driver's license. 
	                At some places you are required to produce two Photo-Ids, that 
	                time it is very useful to have this photo-id you can even go for 
	                some driving lessons. For driving lessons you can go to driving 
	                school or to a private teacher. Private teachers are little cheaper 
	                as compared to driving school. Once you are ready for the test, 
	                again you will have to take an appointment with DMV for the driving 
	                test. If you have driven a lot in India, you just have to have 
	                a hang of the things here. Particularly, as Indian licence is 
	                valid within NT state, it becomes easy to start driving, even 
	                without a temporary license.</font></p> 
	              <p>On the day of appointment you have 
	                to go there with your learning license. The car in which you will 
	                give your driving test should have proper Insurance papers. Also 
	                check all the controls, including signal lights and brake lights. 
	                If any of these is not in shape, you will not be allowed to appear 
	                for the test. This test will be of 100 marks. After your test, 
	                driving inspector will immediately tell you your result. Generally 
	                they explain to you your mistakes so that you can work on them 
	                and rectify. If you have passed you will get your license immediately 
	                in most places. </font></p> 
	              <p>If you fail there is no minimum period 
	                required to appear again. So you can practice again and appear 
	                as soon as you can. <br> 
	                <p><strong><a name="bankaccount"></a>Bank Accounts</strong> <br></p>
	                - They are basically of two types - Savings a/c (with interest) 
	                <br> 
	                - Checking a/c (with NO interest) </font></p> 
	              <p>- Generally most people open a Checking 
	                a/c at first. It&#8217;s a good idea to have a savings account, 
	                as a bulk of the money can lie idle and you can keep track of 
	                your money without spending it. </font></p> 
	              <p>- To open an account you need a social 
	                security number, however since it takes a week or more to get 
	                the social security number one can request the bank to verify 
	                the passport and open the a/c. Later do remember to inform the 
	                bank once you receive your SS number. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Then there are concepts like <br> 
	                - minimum balance - which is either NO or YES <br> 
	                (It is better to open an a/c with NO MINIMUM BALANCE otherwise 
	                you have to maintain the specified minimum amount always in the 
	                account). <br> 
	                - overdraft facility - Again NO or YES <br> 
	                (This allows you some amount of overdraft. This might be beneficial 
	                in some cases, such as when the monthly salary is not received 
	                on time and the house rent, phone bills etc. have to be paid.) 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p>- There are various kinds of check/cheque 
	                books available that one can choose from, such as the kind of 
	                colored paper and printed background design on paper etc. Usually 
	                a set of 200 checks bound together in books of 20 each is sufficient 
	                for 6 months. But it depends on how many checks are issued by 
	                you and at what frequency. The first check book is given by the 
	                bank immediately on opening an account, the other 200 checks are 
	                mailed to you at the given address. </font></p> 
	              <p>- The next thing is to ask for an 
	                ATM card. This allows you to withdraw money 24 hrs. from any ATM 
	                machine of the bank or related ones. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Some banks charge money to issue 
	                an ATM card and the first set of check/cheque books. Something 
	                like $10.00 for the ATM card and another $10.00 for the first 
	                200 checks (10 books of 20 pages each). But most banks do not 
	                charge anything. </font></p> 
	              <p>- The whole procedure of opening 
	                an account takes about 10-15 mins. </font></p> 
	              <p>- A few shops/gas stations etc. ask 
	                for a valid photo-id when payment is made by check. This is just 
	                for verification. (A photo-id could be a U.S. driver's license 
	                or an actual ID-card which is issued by the local Dept. of Motor 
	                Vehicles office. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Small payments such as $1.25 etc. 
	                too can be made by check and it is not absurd to do so. People 
	                carry very little or no cash on person. Most of them make their 
	                payment by Credit card or check. But it is advisable to carry 
	                about $10.00 in cash at all times to cover emergency needs. You 
	                can carry your check book around with you. </font></p> 
	              <p>- The following style is used to 
	                write the amount in words on the check. Say for e.g. the amount 
	                to be paid is $35.47 then you would write: </font></p> 
	              <p>Amount in words $ : THIRTY FIVE &amp; 
	                47/100 </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="cards"></a>Cards</strong> <br> 
	                - It is a fashion to collect cards of all types and store them 
	                in one's wallet. The cards here refer to the plastic type e.g. 
	                credit cards. </font></p> 
	              <p>- So there are cards such as: </font></p> 
	              <p>Credit card, <br> 
	                Debit card, <br> 
	                Bank ATM card, <br> 
	                Shopping Store cards (e.g. Sears card; "SEARS" is the 
	                name of a chain of stores in the U.S.) <br> 
	                Medical benefit card, Telephone calling card, Public library membership 
	                card. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Most wallets have transparent packets 
	                to keep these cards in order. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Credit/Debit Cards: <br> 
	                A credit card allows you to pay for your expenses without bothering 
	                about availability of money at the time of payment. The credit 
	                card company pays for you and later sends you a statement every 
	                month elaborating the payments made. You can then, pay the credit 
	                card company by check. There are certain limits imposed on Credit 
	                cards with regard to the amount of credit available to you, which 
	                vary. </font></p> 
	              <p>VISA and MasterCard are the most 
	                widely accepted credit cards. The other being American Express 
	                card. (Called Am-Ex for short). </font></p> 
	              <p>A Debit card is almost like a check, 
	                since it allows you to spend from your available resources only 
	                (no credit business). This is generally issued by the banks where 
	                you have an account, after you apply for it. </font></p> 
	              <p>It is not so easy to get a credit 
	                card for the first timer in U.S. The application is scrutinized 
	                by the Credit Organization/Bank and the credit history checked 
	                up (They call up the banks where you have an account, to find 
	                out your balance and credit status etc). Actually it the credit 
	                history is traced from your Social Security No. Usually the period 
	                of stay is also an important criteria e.g. at least 6 month stay 
	                is essential to be considered eligible for a Credit card. </font></p> 
	              <p>To build up a good credit history, 
	                many people take loans from the bank. e.g. to buy a car and repay 
	                it in time. This increases the chances of getting a Credit Card 
	                sooner. </font></p> 
	              <p>The most easiest to get is the American 
	                Express Card. They ask for a letter from the employer regarding 
	                salary status etc. once the initial application is verified. <br> 
	                <br> 
	                </font>- The Gold Card is the next 
	                thing to aim for, once you have at least a card. The Credit limit 
	                is higher on the Gold Card apart from other benefits. </font></p> 
	              <p>- The most difficult to get is the 
	                DISCOVER credit card. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Most Credit cards offer other benefits 
	                too, such as mileage accumulation for some airline enabling you 
	                to travel free on that airline anywhere in the U.S. once about 
	                20,000 miles have been accumulated, at the rate of 1 mile per 
	                dollar. Some others offer Rental Car Insurance coverage and so 
	                on. </font></p> 
	              <p>- Most organizations (health clubs 
	                etc.) issue membership cards with neat plastic lamination too. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="shopping"></a>Shopping</strong> <br> 
	                The American system of sizes and measurement is different from 
	                that in India. Most of the shops in the U.S. are the equivalents 
	                of super markets in India. You can go around the shop, buy what 
	                you want and pay at the counter. The important difference you 
	                will notice is, the shops are driven by customer service. So if 
	                you don't like anything that you bought or it doesn't fit you 
	                properly you may return it within a certain period allowed. You 
	                should inquire about the return policy when you buy returnable 
	                goods. Of course you need to preserve the receipt of the purchase. 
	                Most of the time they won't even ask you why you want to return 
	                the goods. </font></p>

	              <p><strong><a name="rentanapt"></a>Renting an Apartment</strong> 
	                <br> 
	                You can get information on how to rent an apartment from the "Apartments" 
	                section of the Yellow Pages, newspaper or 'Rental Guides' which 
	                are available at the stores. To lease (rent) an apartment you 
	                should consider following points: </font></p> 
	              <p>1. Lease period and deposits <br> 
	                Usually there are two types of lease depending on the period of 
	                lease: 6 months lease &amp; 12 months lease. (In some places the 
	                allow 3 month lease too, but the rent increases in that case). 
	                Most of the cases you get 1 month rent free in case you select 
	                12 months lease and you get half months rent free if you select 
	                6 months lease. You have to pay 1 months rent as security deposit 
	                and some amount around 10$ to 15$ as key deposit. Rent for the 
	                apartment in basements is less than other apartments. Very few 
	                people prefer to stay in basements because of security reasons. 
	                So when you ask about availability of apartments it is possible 
	                that the Manager will say only basement apartment is available. 
	                Hence insist for apartment on first or second floor if you don't 
	                want a basement apartment. After renting a basement apartment 
	                you may realize that apartments other than in basements were also 
	                available. </font></p> 
	              <p>2. Utilities <br> 
	                Check whether your rent includes utilities such as hot water, 
	                Cable etc. Otherwise you end up spending around 100$ to 150$ for 
	                electricity bill if you have to pay for hot water. </font></p> 
	              <p>3. Lease Terms <br> 
	                Understand the lease terms properly because most of the times 
	                you need to break the lease in case your project terminates suddenly. 
	                if you want to break the lease <br> 
	                a. You have to give 30 days notice. <br> 
	                b. You lose your security deposit <br> 
	                c. In some cases they (the apartment management) try to find somebody 
	                who wants to rent your apartment. If they don't get anybody within 
	                30 days period You have to pay 1 month's rent extra. In this situation 
	                you lose your security deposit plus one months rent. Get these 
	                terms clarified before signing the lease papers. </font></p> 
	              <p>4. Lease Breaking <br> 
	                If you are sharing an apartment with somebody, Suppose 3 people 
	                are sharing an apartment and all three have their names on lease 
	                papers. In case one of the three wants to leave before the lease 
	                period is over, you need to take a letter from him saying that 
	                all further paper work can be done by the other two people. This 
	                letter is required when your lease period is over or even if you 
	                want to break the lease before that period is over. If you don't 
	                have such a letter you won't be able to break the lease unless 
	                all three have signed the lease break paper. In such cases you 
	                also end up losing your deposit. This is true even for normal 
	                termination of lease period. Be careful and understand these terms 
	                and conditions fully. </font></p> 
	              <p>5. Damages <br> 
	                After renting an apartment carefully observe if there are any 
	                types of damages in the apartment. If you see any, ask your Property 
	                Manager to make a note of it. Otherwise they will deduct some 
	                amount from your security deposit when your lease period is over. 
	                <br> 
	                6. Downgrading and Upgrading <br> 
	                If you want to move to 2 bedroom apartment from 1 bedroom apartment 
	                you have to pay some 100$ to 200$. Many cases downgrading i.e. 
	                moving to 1 bedroom apartment from 2 bedroom apartment is not 
	                allowed. Get clarification on all such points while signing lease 
	                papers. </font></p> 
	              <p>7. Electricity and Telephone connection 
	                <br> 
	                After you rent the apartment you need to inform your local Electric 
	                Supply company that you will be staying in that apartment from 
	                so and so date and that they may bill you from that date. Ask 
	                your local telephone company for a telephone connection by calling 
	                them up. Most of the business takes place on the phone. Surprisingly 
	                all work gets done and promptly too. </font></p> 
	              <p>8. Maintaining an apartment <br> 
	                In most of the apartments you have cooking range, oven, dish washer, 
	                refrigerator etc. Use aluminum foil to cover part of the cooking 
	                range (other than coils) so that it remains clean and in the end 
	                you don't need to spend time in cleaning it. Dish washer soap 
	                is available in liquid or in powder form. Dish washer inner surface 
	                starts becoming blackish after some days. The cleaning liquid 
	                can be used to clean it. This can be done once in a month. Clean 
	                your oven once in a month using oven cleaning liquid. Use plastic 
	                garbage bags in trash cans so that you can just take the bag and 
	                dispose it in the central trash, usually provided in the apartment 
	                complex. </font></p> 
	              <p>9. Laundry <br> 
	                If the apartment itself does not have a washer/dryer, there will 
	                usually be a common laundry room in the complex where you can 
	                do your weekly washing/drying. Such common machines usually are 
	                coin operated machines so you'll need a few quarters and also 
	                your own favorite detergent powder. <br>

	                </font><strong>Decorating, Furnishing 
	                YOUR house </strong><br> 
	                Of course this is not an advice for interior designing but to 
	                make your APARTMENT look like a HOME. Home is not a place with 
	                four walls, but where you have furniture also :). The greatest 
	                place to get the things you need for your house is Garage Sales. 
	                You can get things like Sofa sets to Wall paintings very cheep 
	                from this source. </font></p> 
	              <p>Garage sale is a second-hand, used 
	                things sale which includes household items such as furniture like 
	                couch etc, appliances such as T.V., stereo, clothes/jackets, other 
	                used items. </font></p> 
	              <p>This is held in peoples garages or 
	                backyards generally on weekends. They are a nice place to buy 
	                furniture from, which is usually in good shape. Anybody who wants 
	                to sell old used things, can hold a garage sale and put up a sign 
	                near the house announcing such a sale. The prices are negotiable. 
	                Generally people advertise through local newspaper ad columns. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p>The early morning time on Sat. and 
	                Sun. between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. is the best to hunt around 
	                for used things in garage sales.</font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="buyacar"></a>Buying a Car </strong><br> 
	                If you are going to stay at a particular place for quite some 
	                time say more than three months, then its better to buy a car 
	                rather than rent one. Buying a car involves quite some work. It 
	                is better to be cautious while buying a car, 'cause owning a car 
	                brings you freedom and you own a vehicle but you need to maintain 
	                the car and take care of any problems. The main concern while 
	                buying a car is its maintenance cost should not be high, otherwise 
	                you will lose a lot. So here is what experience tells us. </font></p> 
	              <p>Buying a car in America is very easy, 
	                there are lots of used cars for sale and there is never a shortage. 
	                It is just the question of deciding the budget and type of car 
	                to be bought. </font></p> 
	              <p>Most people prefer Japanese cars 
	                over American makes simply because of the easy reusability. The 
	                most popular Japanese car makes are Honda and Toyota. </font></p> 
	              <p>Types of models? There are two categories 
	                of cars, 2-door, 4-door.The 2-d are cheaper. Then comes the type 
	                of transmission (gear), automatic or stick-shift. Most people 
	                buy automatic transmission. Such cars are very easy to drive. 
	                (Almost all Indian cars are of the stick-shift variety). </font></p> 
	              <p>Where to look? The local newspapers 
	                carry a lot of car sale advertisements everyday. You should see 
	                the paper and decide on the ones you are interested in. Next call 
	                up the owner at the tel. no. given, as early in the day as possible 
	                and fix up an appointment to visit and see the car. Test drive 
	                it, if you like it and the price is ok, tell the owner that you'd 
	                like to get it checked up by a mechanic. This is the normal practice. 
	                There is nothing to feel shy about asking the car to be checked 
	                up. This will save you a lot of money later after purchasing the 
	                car from unforeseen problems that some used cars land up into. 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p>Look up the yellow pages in the local 
	                tel. directory to get the list of car mechanics or just ask colleagues 
	                to recommend one. If that doesn't work out, ask the local AAA 
	                (American Automobile Association) office to recommend someone 
	                to you. For a fee of about $25-30 the mechanic will check up the 
	                car and tell you the problems or possible problems if any. Some 
	                people do it for free. It is good to tell the auto mechanic to 
	                check up the following things with additional care in addition 
	                to their regular :- <br> 
	                1) Brake cylinder, drum and worn out pads <br> 
	                2) Transmission. (this is the costliest part in an automatic car 
	                ) <br> 
	                3) If it is a 4 speed never buy it. 5 speed is ok. <br> 
	                4) Check for rust in bottom, radiators, muffler and tailpipe. 
	                <br> 
	                5) Check for vibrations when you brake from 40mph, without down-shifting. 
	                if there are vibrations, either break pads or steering pinion 
	                is in bad shape. Get 4 people to sit in the car and you can make 
	                out if the suspensions are ok, when you make a sharp turn. <br> 
	                6) Most important, check for oil leaks, and whether the car gives 
	                you power speed/pick-up when you try to accelerate. You can feel 
	                if it's OK. <br> 
	                7) Last, check for emission whether the smoke is black (thick), 
	                which means oil is also burned with fuel = the car is beyond its 
	                life. The piston rings might be leaving a gap in the cylinders 
	                because of wear. In that case, don't buy the car, because you 
	                will have to change the cylinder, piston and rings which will 
	                come to double the cost. <br> 
	                8) Ask the owner to give the records of the maintenance he has 
	                done, like new tires etc. Also, make sure you don't go beyond 
	                3rd hand purchase. There must be something seriously wrong with 
	                the car if people have changed owners drastically. <br> 
	                9) Air filter, valve etc. OK? </font></p> 
	              <p>Ask the owner to discount the price 
	                of the car by the amount required for the repairs suggested by 
	                the mechanic. Or else ask him to get it repaired for you. The 
	                rates of the used cars have some standard values which are generally 
	                not exceeded. These values can be checked up in something called 
	                "Blue Book" which is a text available in the public 
	                library or with car dealers. So car models classified as per Year 
	                of make have their value listed in the Blue Book. There is a cost 
	                deduction to be applied for the mileage that the car has been 
	                driven for, which is mentioned in most Blue Books. That gives 
	                a fair idea about the standard cost of any used car. Moreover 
	                there is ample scope for price negotiation. Generally private 
	                owners who sell through ads can give better discounts than used 
	                car dealers. Generally car dealers stick to the Blue Book Price 
	                but usually ask more. </font></p> 
	              <p>Mileage is also a consideration while 
	                purchasing a used car. Lesser the better. The ideal average is 
	                10000 miles per year. So a car manufactured in 1987 may have a 
	                driven mileage of about 70000 miles in 1994 and not more than 
	                80000. These are approx. figures. </font></p> 
	              <p>After buying a car you need to get 
	                it insured. You cannot drive a car in the U.S. without proper 
	                Insurance. The car has to be insured against collisions etc. There 
	                are various vehicle Insurance companies having various deals. 
	                Look up the yellow pages and call up some of them and ask for 
	                their rates. Then decide on one. The Insurance coverage period 
	                and the type of Insurance chosen and your age (more for less than 
	                25 yrs.) decide the amount to be paid. The "comprehensive", 
	                "collision" are terms used by the Insurance companies 
	                to describe the type of insurance coverage. Get everything explained 
	                properly. There is sometimes windscreen coverage too, for a nominal 
	                additional amount per month; this insures your windshield against 
	                damage (a windscreen replacement may cost about $200.00 approx. 
	                otherwise). </font></p> 
	              <p>You have to get the emission testing 
	                done on your car before it can be registered. In case the previous 
	                owner has got it done and the test is valid still, then there 
	                is no need to do it again for the specified period. The valid 
	                test papers are required for Registration. </font></p> 
	              <p>The local vehicle registration office 
	                will issue a temporary registration for 45 days and meanwhile 
	                process and prepare the proper number plates. The documents required 
	                to get a registration are - Car ownership (title) papers, Emission 
	                Test papers, Car Insurance papers. After proper registration is 
	                done you can drive your car. However you should have a Driver's 
	                License. Actually each state in the U.S. has different laws. Most 
	                states allow you to drive with an I.D.P. (International Driving 
	                Permit) for a ye ar or so. But others require that you get a local 
	                Driver's License. The driver's license can be obtained from the 
	                local DMV office after a written and driving test. Refer to the 
	                section on obtaining a driver's license for details. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="rentacar"></a>Renting a Car</strong> <br> 
	                Car is a necessity in most of the places here in U.S. Either you 
	                buy a car or you can rent a car. You can pay either a monthly 
	                rate or daily rent. Though its expensive to rent a car for a month 
	                or so, it might be required if you are going to stay at that place 
	                for a small period of time. Here is some information you will 
	                need OR should know when you want to rent a car. <br> 
	                - The driver/co-drivers may need to be at least 25 years old. 
	                <br> 
	                - Credit Card is required to rent a car. Else a deposit of about 
	                $300 etc. Most companies do not allow you to rent a car if you 
	                do not have a credit card. <br> 
	                - You need a valid driver's license to drive a rental car. <br> 
	                - Well known car renting companies are - Hertz, Avis, Alamo, Budget, 
	                Dollar, Enterprise etc. <br> 
	                - Car Insurance has to be bought for the Rental car. It is a separate 
	                charge or is included in the total per day renting cost. Some 
	                credit card companies pay for the insurance if you use their card 
	                to book a car e.g. American Express Credit Card, in such a case 
	                you need not buy insurance from the car rental company. <br> 
	                - You have to register the other drivers too as co-drivers of 
	                the rental car while booking the car. They should have valid driver's 
	                licenses too. Nobody else should be allowed to drive the car other 
	                than those registered! <br> 
	                - Unlimited mileage or fixed mileage is also a criteria which 
	                decides the hiring charges of a rental car. <br> 
	                - You can make the booking over the phone. But you have to go 
	                personally to pick-up the car from the renting agency. <br> 
	                - Generally the gas (fuel) tank is full and you are supposed to 
	                return it with a full tank. <br> 
	                - Some rental agencies do not allow you to rent their car for 
	                travel outside the state. <br> 
	                - There are various types of cars that can be booked. Generally 
	                depending on the seating capacity, such as small, medium, compact, 
	                large, full-size, premium, mini-van, van etc. One may even choose 
	                the make of the car if available. The rental agencies maintain 
	                the cars in good shape and generally have new cars. </font></p> 
	              <p>- The renting charges vary depending 
	                on the season, weekend/weekday, for how many days you want the 
	                car, how much in advance you are booking, availability, type of 
	                car etc. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="doctorus"></a>Doctors in U.S.</strong> 
	                <br> 
	                God forbid, but if something happens to you, here is what you 
	                should know: </font></p> 
	              <p>- The Medical Benefit Card which 
	                is sent by the Medical Insurance Company is an important card 
	                and should be acquired at the earliest. Fill up the Medical forms 
	                to ensure that you are registered with the Insurance Company after 
	                you land in the U.S. </font></p> 
	              <p>- This card entitles you to coverage 
	                under certain medical categories only. <br> 
	                - There is a $100 deductible. Which means if you land into medical 
	                problems, you have to pay the first </font></p> 
	              <p>100 dollars from your pocket. Thereafter 
	                the Insurance company takes over the payment depending on the 
	                coverage plan etc. <br> 
	                - There are two acceptable ways of payment for the Doctor's services 
	                which depends on the Doctor. The Doctor's receptionist is the 
	                best person to ask payment related questions. Some Doctors ask 
	                you to pay them (by cash, check, credit card etc.) immediately 
	                after the service. The receptionist will then give you a formal 
	                bill, which you must send (by postal mail) to the Medical Insurance 
	                Company along with the claim form supplied by DCI (which comes 
	                in with the initial package soon after you land in the U.S.) The 
	                Medical Ins. Co. will then send you a check after verifying your 
	                claim. Other Doctors will note down the details of your Medical 
	                Insurance Company from your card. They will then send the bill 
	                to the Insurance Company and receive the payment directly. You 
	                need not pay the Doctor. </font></p> 
	              <p>But in both the above modes, remember 
	                that there are certain charges which the Insurance Company will 
	                not pay and which they don't cover, such as the first $100. So 
	                find out the details from the Insurance Co. about your respective 
	                coverage/medical problem etc. </font></p> 
	              <p>- For certain kinds of medical problems 
	                where you have to visit the Doctor repeatedly, only a fixed number 
	                of visits per year are paid by the Insurance Company and not all. 
	                <br> 
	                - How to decide on the Doctor to visit? <br> 
	                Ask your colleagues or other Indian friends. Otherwise check up 
	                the yellow pages (phone directory). Look under the "Physicians" 
	                heading. Telephone the Doctor and fix up an appointment. Only 
	                in cases of emergency, do the Doctors see you immediately, otherwise 
	                it is always by appointment. <br> 
	                - You can claim the expenses for any Dr. prescribed medicine that 
	                you have to buy from the Drug (medical) Store. <br> 
	                NOTE: <br> 
	                - Pain in the lower back and strain between the shoulder blades 
	                and a stiff neck are very common due to the kind of spring mattresses 
	                and soft foam pillows available in the U.S. and one just needs 
	                to get used to it. <br> 
	                - Beware of Dental problems since they are usually not fully covered 
	                under the Insurance Scheme. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong><a name="itus"></a>Income Tax in US:</strong> 
	                <br> 
	                Income Tax return filing is very simple in US as compared to India. 
	                Here Tax forms are very simple and easy to fill up. One need not 
	                know all about Taxation laws, but still can very easily file tax 
	                return. Here in US there are two types of taxes. One is the FEDERAL 
	                Tax which is something like our Income tax and the other is the 
	                STATE Tax. Last day of filing the income tax return is 15th of 
	                April. Accounting year is considered from 1st of January till 
	                31st of December. US has a Tax treaty with India. Under this Tax 
	                treaty one can file his tax return either in India or in US as 
	                per the convenience. But you need to show your income earned in 
	                either of the country. </font></p> 
	              <p>Suppose you come to US in the middle 
	                of the year. You must be definitely having some income in India 
	                before you came to US in that particular financial year. Also 
	                some part of salary is paid to you even when you are in US. This 
	                income is taxable and hence you pay tax on that income. Generally 
	                you pay tax on this income in India as in most of the cases income 
	                tax is deducted at source. So one pays tax on the income in India. 
	                So now you are liable only for the tax on the income that you 
	                earn in US. </font></p> 
	              <p>Here there are different types of 
	                forms for different category of people. For those who are US residents 
	                and who have status of Resident Aliens, they have to file what 
	                is called 1040EZ form (form 1040 easy). Any person who is in the 
	                US for more than 183 days continuously, gains status of Resident 
	                Alien. Any person who is in US for less than 183 days in that 
	                financial year is considered as Non Resident Alien. </font></p> 
	              <p>Non Resident Alien will not have 
	                some Tax benefits which any US citizen or Resident Alien will 
	                have. Here in particular, Non resident Alien will not get Standard 
	                deduction on their income. Also they have to pay Tax as per the 
	                Flat rate. So basically when you file your Tax return as NR you 
	                land up paying more taxes. But you have to file 1040NR when you 
	                are having status as Non resident Alien. </font></p> 
	              <p>For filing Tax return form one can 
	                get help from the government body which is know as IRS (Internal 
	                Revenue Services). This is same as Income Tax department in India. 
	                Also one has to pay tax to the state government. Each state has 
	                a different tax law for the State Tax. Booklet of information 
	                on this is available on request. Tax forms are available freely 
	                at the public places like Post office, Public library where one 
	                can get the form that he/she requires. Also, government gives 
	                special services for the people who need guidance. One can get 
	                this information even on phone by calling them. One can even go 
	                in person to understand the form. </font></p> 
	              <p>Apart from these facilities provided 
	                by the government one can even go to private Tax consultants. 
	                They charge somewhere between $30 to $60. They take care of every 
	                detail and one need not bother about anything. Along with the 
	                Tax you are supposed to send one form called "W2" form. 
	                This form is provided by the employer to all the employees. The 
	                form contains all the information based on the salary of the person. 
	                Also all the taxes paid by the employer to the State government 
	                as well as Federal government. Details about the social security 
	                taxes and the medical taxes paid by the employer is also included 
	                in this form. </font></p> 
	              <p>There are three copies of this form. 
	                One copy is to be sent with the State Tax form, one with the Federal 
	                Tax form and one is for the employee's personal record. Before 
	                sending the W2 form one should check the validity of the information 
	                in it. Most important is the correct social security number. If 
	                there is any change in any of the information one should inform 
	                the employer ASAP. Employer is supposed to send the corrected 
	                information to IRS and also a corrected copy to the employee which 
	                is called W2C f form. </font></p>

	              <p> Stress is a part of professional 
	                or student life and more so when you are living in an alien country. 
	                The sooner you understand and accept it the more easily you will 
	                adapt to your new environment. Depression and home sickness are 
	                symptoms that you should look out for. With this we all feel you

	                as you are. Exchange thoughts, info and also your problems/worries.
