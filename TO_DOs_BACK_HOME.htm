<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>TO DO'S</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>BACK HOME</b><br>
<br>
1) Apply for &quot;complete&quot; transcripts. You may need transcripts for
applying for other universities, internship, jobs, etc. You may take 10-15
copies.<br>
2) Inform all official institutions (hostel office, department, post office,
banks) of your permanent address.<br>
3) Leave an authorization letter addressed to the post master, authorizing your
parents/guardians to receive letters for you.<br>
4) Leave several blank sheets with your signature with your parents.<br>
5) Get your International Driver's Permit. Helps to rent cars in US.<br>
6) Get permit for taking cash<br>
This can be got from any bank authorized to do so. You can get this within a
month of the date of the flight. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The following documents
have to be taken along to get the permit : </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Passport + copy, air
ticket, I-20 student copy + copy, grade cards + copies, PC + copy, XII std
pass/mark sheet + copy, aid &amp; admission letters + copies, bank advance/ any
other form of payment. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Other things to be done in
advance </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Learn typing <br>
Learn driving <br>
Learn to cook- Don't learn the desi way of one day before leaving. Put some
effort &amp; practice for maybe a week. It might be well worth the effort. You
just need to have a feel for it... effort and practice help only to an
extent...once you get the feel, it is all quite easy... even easier if you have
lots of instant stuff on hand. <br>
Make outstation purchases (sweater, thermal underwear, cassettes, etc. -
available/cheap in Delhi, Bombay) <br>
Get medical checkup done <br>
Dental - A must...Health insurance in this country does not cover dental
problems and is really costly...go early to the dentist...it takes time to
recuperate, in case u need some surgery or something <br>
Fresh checkup, especially if you have a major ailment <br>
Get prescriptions &amp; medicines for all common ailments (the technical name
of the medicine along with Indian/US brand name). <br>
Get your eye-sight checked - get a new prescription. Buy at least one extra
pair of glasses. <br>
Get tested for TB if possible (chest X-ray) - else they will do it at the
University <br>
- Do a PPD Mantoux test. If negative no need for chest X-ray. Take vaccination
for MMR. Its a 2 dose vaccine to be taken at an interval of one month from the
1st to 2nd. If u don't take it in desh its going to cost a lot in US. Also take
tetanus. Paranoid characters can take Rabies, yellow fever, malaria, hepatits
A,B,C..Z vaccines :-) <br>
- Some universities just need a doctor's signature on a sheet of paper the
university provides...the doctor might insist that u take the injection...it is
a good idea to take MMR and tetanus in any case... And don’t forget to get the
medical form. It applies to UB and it should be in your application packet. <br>
Get cassettes recorded which you may like to take with you - Lots of them. No
point taking western music casettes. CD's are cheap in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

music. <br>

give temporary accommodation, if necessary.<br>
- Keep in touch with somebody at the university, till u reach <br>
Note your/parent's bank A/c Number - Might be useful when you want to transfer
money. </span></p>

Arial'>EMIGRATION CLEARANCE</span></strong></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Get this done after the
visa. It’s a day’s work. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>You can get this from a
venue other than the place of issue of the passport - by showing that your
place of residence falls in the jurisdiction of that passport office (It might
take some time, and pain). ECNR form is available at passport office or travel
agent.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Take the following things
with you - </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Passport <br>
Cash for the ECNR fees. May vary, check it out. <br>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>At one counter show the
filled form &amp; get a slip; go inside and show your documents at the checking
counter; pay applicable fees at the cash counter; collect passport next day
with ECNR stamp. Collect passport the same day.... </span></p>

ARRANGEMENTS</span></strong></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The next thing to do is
blocking tickets (this implies no financial commitment). This can be done via
travel agents. Make sure the Travel Agent is good (examples of dependable
travel agents are -Travel Corporation of India (TCI), Thomas cook, etc). </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Block flights with many
airlines/agencies. Put pressure on the agencies and get as much info as
possible. Much before the flight call the airlines themselves and confirm your
ticket.<br>
<br>
Indicate whether you want Asian Vegetarian Meal (AVM), non-smoking section, etc
</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Cross-check everything the
travel agent says. <br>
Some airlines offer Frequent Flier programs (e.g. Air France, TWA) [i.e. after
a certain number of miles of flying with that airline you get a free ticket].
Enroll in such programs as you might again travel to and from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Avoid change of airline. A
direct flight is the best. If change of airline can't be avoided, leave at
least 4-6 hrs gap between the scheduled arrival of one flight and the scheduled
departure of the connecting flight. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Baggage is usually safe
with a single airline - change of airline sometimes leads to misplaced luggage.
Some airlines don't take care of baggage transfer - you may have to personally
carry it (check this while booking). Ensure if the baggage will be taken care
of at every stop over.</span></p>
