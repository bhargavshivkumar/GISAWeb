	<h3>To Do's after VISA</h3>
<p>Welcome to the "To-Do's After VISA" page. For packing checklists and other travel-related guidelines, this is the page.
<p>	<a name="pack"></a><strong>PACKING 
	                CHECKLIST</strong></font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">Start your packing 
	                well in advance <br> 
	                - Usually doesn&#8217;t work :) We guys did not. We can gladly 
	                advise you to. </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">Buy two good boxes 
	                - they should be able to withstand a lot of mishandling. They 
	                should be as large as possible within the size limitations (however 
	                most airlines are not very strict about baggage size). Put identification 
	                marks and labels both inside &amp; outside the boxes (apart from 
	                this the airlines will also provide you with adhesive labels). 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify"><strong>Box specifications</strong> 
	                </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">As an example the 
	                Air India economy class baggage specifications to the USA are 
	                given below. Note the specifications may be different for other 
	                countries/airlines. </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">2 pieces of baggage 
	                with total linear dimension (l+b+h) not exceeding 270cm (106"). 
	                Moreover the total linear dimension of each piece should not be 
	                over 158cm (62"). </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">The weight of each 
	                bag should not exceed 32kg (70lb) [note: they are not very particular 
	                about this when it comes to students, but you can exceed by too 
	                much] </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">Carry on baggage: 
	                In addition you can carry a bag with linear dimension not exceeding 
	                115cm (45") onboard (fits beneath the seat). <br> 
	                If you are taking a break outside USA/Canada contact your travel 
	                agent or airlines for details. <br> 
	                - The baggage sizes are almost standardized. Be careful about 
	                the weight of your baggage. You might save frustration at the 
	                airport when you are leaving.</font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">Do tie the suitcases 
	                with nylon ropes, as the boxes are thrown when changing flights 
	                and can very well be damaged / broken. The airline authorities 
	                will repair / replace accordingly </font></p> 
	              <p align="justify">Things to be kept 
	                in the boxes - checklist</font></p> 
	              <ul> 
	                <li>Copy of all certificates/documents 
	                  (originals in hand baggage) </font></li> 
	                <li>Important application 
	                  materials (SOP, reco letters, admit letter, etc) </font></li> 
	                <li>Necessary books/notebooks 
	                  (some suggested books are - Clark's Tables, a good dictionary/thesaurus, 
	                  a booklet for units conversion) [note: there should be no legal 
	                  hassles taking Xerox copies of books - but don't flaunt them 
	                  to Americans/Profs] </font></li> 
	                <li>Copy of address 
	                  book/telephone book/diary <br> 
	                  - Leave important phone numbers of people both in the US and 
	                  in India with your parents..... </font></li> 
	                <li>Some stationery 
	                  and related items suggested (not absolutely necessary - just 
	                  for the first few weeks) screw driver - a tool kit might help. 
	                  </font></li> 
	                <li>Medical history 
	                  files </font></li> 
	                <li>Gifts (suggested: 
	                  rollable pictures, handicrafts, etc) <br> 
	                  - a gift for your advisor would be appreciated by him greatly.. 
	                  Especially if he is an American...make it ethnic... </font></li> 
	                <li>Non-technical 
	                  books (fiction/religious). [note: second-hand story books are 
	                  cheap in the US] </font></li> 
	                <li>1 pair leather 
	                  chappals, 2 hawai chappals (+ extra straps) </font></li> 
	                <li>Soap (bath), toothbrushes 
	                  (slightly costly in the US - 1 or 2 bucks) etc Do not bother 
	                  to bring washing soaps / products. You will be using washing 
	                  machines here and you can get the detergent here.<br> 
	                  - get just one soap cake and one toothbrush... If you are choosy 
	                  about some Indian brand soap or something due to medical reasons 
	                  or preference, carry lot of them. You can actually get good 
	                  razors and shaving foams here...but if you already have a real 
	                  good razor, bring it along... </font></li> 
	                <li>Cassettes </font></li> 
	                <li>Clothes <br> 
	                  Usually clothes are machine washed once a week (Laundromat) 
	                  - hence one week supply of clothes (+ one week backup) is needed. 
	                  Get all clothes little loose - clothes may shrink in machine 
	                  wash &amp; you will probably grow fatter. <br> 
	                  - clothes will shrink and you will grow fatter...the frequency 
	                  of washing will actually depend on you... </font></li> 
	              </ul> 
	              <ol> 
	                <li>14-15 sets of 
	                  undergarments, socks, handkerchiefs <br> 
	                  - Get some 2-3 pairs of socks. Socks are quite cheap here and 
	                  available at $5 for a 6 pack. </font></li> 
	                <li> 5 sets of good 
	                  shirts, pants </font></li> 
	                <li>- Maybe more if 
	                  u are lazy &amp; do laundry once in 2 weeks. <br> 
	                  - you get good jeans here from $10 onwards unless u are too 
	                  brand name conscious... </font></li> 
	                <li> a good swimming 
	                  trunk + few shorts </font></li> 
	                <li>a tie + 1-2 belts 
	                  <br> 
	                  - get the belts in india </font></li> 
	                <li>3-6 ordinary towels 
	                  </font></li> 
	                <li>a bed sheet <br> 
	                  - Should say bedcover. Also get a couple of pillow covers. <br> 
	                  - the pillows here are of a different size than those in India... 
	                  </font></li>

	                  wear </font></li> 
	                <li> thermal underwear 
	                  (1-4) Though Buffalo is very cold, not all people use thermal 
	                  wears. Depends on your ability to bear cold.</font> 
	                  Costs around 10 bucks a set here. one set should do, at most 
	                  2. U can buy it here, since u won't need it till November end. 
	                  </font></li> 
	                <li>extra woolen sweaters. 
	                  Winter wear is also relatively cheap here, so don&#8217;t bother 
	                  carrying jackets from India.</font> </li>

	              <p>2. Call the Landlord to schedule 
	                for an appointment to see the house. Before making appointment 
	                ask him few questions like number of bedrooms, rent he is expecting. 
	                Clarify things such as, heating, utilities, electric bills, whether 
	                it is additional or it is included in the rent. </font></p>

	              <p>4. When you see the house make sure

	                may need repair/improvement please clarify this with him/her. 
	                Inquire about the heating bill that is expected during winter. 
	                It could be anywhere between $100 - $200 /month for the house.

	              <p>5. If you like the house and the 
	                deal, ask your seniors with whom you are staying and make sure 
	                that anyone of them is there while signing the lease. Lease is 
	                usually, signed for nine months or a year. Check all the conditions

	                More about phone connections... Verizon provides you service for 
	                the local calls. It is always advantageous to take flat rate options 
	                service rather than taking limited number of calls service. AT&amp;T 
	                or MCI will provide service for your long distance (within USA) 
	                and international calls (including India). Call both MCI and AT&amp;T 
	                and discuss the deals they are offering and choose best of them. 
	                Check for the service charges apart from the basic rate/minute. 
	                Take call organizer service as it becomes easier to divide bills 
	                between your housemates. </font></p>

	                courses online. Initially you can register maximum of 18 credit 
	                hrs. So register for as many as you can. Later on you can attend 
	                classes and choose between the courses. You usually have some 
	                3 weeks time for this. </font></p> 
	              <p><strong>Food : </strong></font></p> 
	              <p>Those who are non-veg should not 
	                have much problem finding the food on campus or off campus. You 
	                can get good food at Burger King and other cafeterias on campus. 
	                Keep 5-10$ with you on the first day.<br> 
	                Those who are Veggie's can get Veggie Whopper at Burger King or 
	                plain fried rice at Young Chow (Chinese Restaurant)</font></p> 
	              <p><strong>Finding Job or Assistantship: 
	                </strong></font></p> 
	              <p>To earn $$$ while you study there 
	                are two ways. </font></p> 
	              <p>a. You can do part time job which 
	                pays between 5-8$ per hr. This job can be in library, computer 
	                lab etc. </font></p> 
	              <p>b. You can get assistantship from 
	                your department which will be either TA or RA .You can also get 
	                assistantship from other departments or administrative offices 
	                which are called GA (Graduate Assistantship) which covers your 
	                tuition and you will stipend depending on your position (it varies 
	                from 600-1000$ per month).Initially your goal should be to get 
	                funding from the department itself. If that seems not possible 
	                then you may try to find graduate assistantship and job. </font></p> 
	              <p>0. As mentioned above first thing 
	                you should do is to get your resume attractive. As most of the 
	                jobs (for engineering students) are in computers try to show good 
	                computer skills (as a lab assistant skills means knowing windows 
	                and MS Office). </font></p> 
	              <p>1. You can get GA in administrative 
	                offices and technical centers </font></p> 
	              <p>2. You can do job as a computer lab 
	                assistant or in libraries. Try to visit as many offices as possible 
	                and submit your resume to them. Do not forget to apply on South 
	                Campus. There are many jobs on South Campus also. </font></p> 
	              <p>3. You cannot work off campus during 
	                the first year of your study.</font><br> 
	                 </font></p>
