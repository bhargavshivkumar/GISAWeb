<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
<div id="accordion" class="faq">
	<h2><a href="#">What is the fee amount I have to bring ?</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>Fees: Please bring a DD (from Nationalized Bank) payable to University at Buffalo 
		Amount : As specified in your I20 document
		For other monetary questions, please go through the Monetary issues</P>
	</div>
	
	
	<h2><a href="#">Does it help to come early?</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			We suggest you to come 10-15 days before orientation starts so that you can hunt for apartments, get electricity / gas connections 
			and settle down. New students cannot start working on-campus jobs unless they get their SSN (Social Security Number - identification 
			number given to each person who legally stays in US). You need to get an offer letter from on campus job employer to apply for SSN. 
			You would get detailed information on this ics and other such related ics during the orientation. So you DO NOT have to come early
			for getting on-campus jobs. Professors generally do not meet before school starts. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<h2><a href="#">On-Campus jobs</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Getting an on-campus job is not guaranteed. If you get an on campus job, you will earn, on an average, $7.15-$8 per hour and 
		you can work for a maximum of 20 hours per week, during semester hours.
		There will be other opportunities in course of time, as the semester begins.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<h2><a href="#">RA / TA</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Getting RA/TA is dependent on the department. It solely depends on your ability and your skills.You need to come here
			and try. Statistics-wise, 2 out of 30 students may end up with an assistantship.
			TAs for most departments are already appointed with admission. You can try for RAs but you get it only if
			the professor has a project on which you can work on, you have the required skill sets and you are able to prove it. 
			This generally may take a semester.
			Normally UB first year master students won’t get RA and TA positions as professors will take their time to judge your credentials, as 
			PHD students will normally be given that position .
			During the second year, you may end up with a position if your professor is satisfied with your performance.

	<h2><a href="#">When should I come?</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		We suggest you come somewhere in the first week of august.
		New BCIS regulations mandate that a F1 visa student shall not land in the US more than 30 days prior to the date indicated in the I-20.
		It would be great if you can schedule your flight so that you land in Buffalo in the evening after 5 PM. Weekends will also be preferable.
		If for some reason you don't get flights according to this timing, it is still fine.
		</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<h2><a href="#">Documents</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Keep all your documents like passport, I-20, travelers checks, letters from University at Buffalo, ticket in your hand luggage.
		You get an I-94 when you come to US ( at the Port of Entry ).
		Please staple it with your visa. Please do not misplace it. It is the proof of your entry to USA.

	<h2><a href="#">Calling cards</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		It is advisable to carry calling cards worth $5 which you can get at your travel agency or at the intermediate airports. 
		This will help you call us from anywhere if there is any problem and also you can make a call back home when you come here 
		to inform your folks of safe arrival. You can always email them. 
		But it is better to get calling cards and use them through cell phones...it will be charged about a dollar higher when used from a public booth.
		</p>
		
	</div>
	
	
	
	<h2><a href="#">Course work at UB</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Coursework is somewhat simple and complex as in every semester you have to enroll for 4 courses unless you are
		getting a TA or RA position (3 courses u have to enroll) and normally the fall and spring lasts for 3 months so  you will have  assignments ,tests 
		and projects for all subjects at a same time. Unless you plan, you will end with some sort of trouble.
		</p>
		
	</div>
	
	
	<h2><a href="#"> How many credits are required to complete MS?</a></h2>
	<div>
	<p>
		In every semester you have to enroll for 4 courses, each course weighs 3 credits and totally 30 credits to complete MS with thesis/Comprehensive exam clearance.
		<br/>With respect to many branches thesis is compulsory. But with respect to EE, it is optional you can either clear comprehensive exam (Questions will come from all subjects you taken during your MS programme) or go for thesis program if really interested to do thesis work. Also as there are only 30 credits to complete you can complete your studies in 3 semesters, ee students only).
		<br/>MIS students have to complete 36 credits in one year (compulsory, 18 credits each semester) and MBA students have to complete 60 credits in their two year program.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2><a href="#">Bank Accounts and mobile?</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		During the orientation week UB helps you to open bank accounts in university itself as banks like Bank of America, 
		HSBC officials will be there around.AT&T is the major telecom provider and
		they will available for you to get a new connection during the orientation week.
		</p>
		
	</div>
	<h2><a href="#">Living in Buffalo?</a></h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		On campus is a bit very costly as your living expenses will end up around $800 per month as 
		off campus expenses will range around 450-500$.	
		Engineering/Management classes will be held in north campus. Usually Indian students prefer to stay in south campus 
		and mostly clustered in three streets (ENGLEWOOD, HEATH and MERRIMAC), Princeton and Springville as you  can manage the 
		total living cost  in and around $450 also groceries like BUDWEYS , TOPS and ALDI are located very near from these streets. You have to walk for around 10 minutes to reach main bus stop in south campus, from there you can hop on a UB bus which operates between south and north campus and it has a frequency of 3-5 minutes during semester days.
		<br/>Also some people stay in TRIAD apartments located near north campus but the room rent is somewhat costly there.
		<br/>One thing I want to share is the house owners will need you sign a lease agreement of around 1 year and you have to 
		pay 1  month  rent advance as  security and you get the rooms in and around $250 (including water and garbage), electricity bill
		will be around 15$ per person and internet bill will come around 15 bucks , heating cost will normally soar during winter 
		(even more than 100$ per head), so early you arrive here, better for  you to choose a good insulated house( as some houses won’t 
		have least insulation).
