<p class="question">After getting your Admit Letter:</p>

<p>- Confirm acceptance by sending in the letter of intent to accept your admission offer.</p>

<p>- Email graduate secretary or admissions representative of your department about any scores / documents to be submitted and follow up getting your I-20s.</p>

<p>- Apply for a date for the visa interview as soon as possible. Plan accordingly, as you will need your I-20 on the date of the visa interview.</p>

<p>- Apply for bank loan (if necessary) </p>
<p>- Enquire from the bank (Canara Bank, SBI, Indian Bank) by May end &amp; apply by June. The red tape takes a month for loan approval. No security required for loans less than 1 lakh. (This might have changed or the amount without security can vary among banks. Check this out). You might need to take an LIC policy for the loan amount. Also banks usually give only 75% of what at u apply for. You need bills/invoices to claim a refund from the bank. Travel agents can give invoices for the amount you ask for. Enquire while booking.</p>

<p>- Make your passport valid for 6 months more than your stay indicated in your I-20.</p>

<p>- Contact GISA members / department representatives for specific queries. </p>

<h3>F1 Visa:</h3>

<p>The "F-1" visa is for USA academic studies for foreign students. It is a non-immigrant visa for a student that will permit the applicant to stay for a particular period of time in the United States to accomplish the purpose of studying. (While a non-immigrant visa limits a visitor to a particular length of time, an immigrant visa allows an alien to stay in the United States indefinitely.)

<h3>How to apply:</h3>

<p>Please visit www.vfs-usa.co.in for complete information. More details will posted here soon.
<p class="question">SEVIS &amp; BCIS:

<p>SEVIS - STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR INFORMATION SYSTEM. Beginning January 30, 2003, all I-20 forms issued by academic educational institutions, must be created within the SEVIS system. As of January 30, 2003 all new I-20s issued on or after that date must be SEVIS compatible documents. First time students will be able to enter the U.S. with non-SEVIS documents issued prior to January 30, 2003. All continuing students must present a SEVIS-generated form

<p>I-20, if they are applying for a visa after January 30, 2003. These new forms are printed on a single sheet of paper and will have a large black bar code on the top right hand side of the form.

<p>SEVIS is basically a system to enable U.S. academic institutions to maintain accurate and timely data about foreign students, their dependents, and communicate this information to the now BCIS formerly known as U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Department of State in real time.

<p>BCIS: The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) became the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) on March 1, moving from itsorganizational home in the Department of Justice to the newly-created Department of Homeland Security.

<p>Regarding loans kindly look into FAQ's given below.

<p>Note : As a matter of fact you need to show the funds available with you as liquid cash, liquid assets and properties and other immovable assets and annual income.

<p>Liquid Cash : This can be certified by the Bank in which the sponsor is having an account on bank's letterhead and duly stamped along with a seal. It can be supported by 6 months Bank statements or Pass books whatever available with Bank.

<p>Your sponsors bank account should contain cash for first year funds of university fee + Living expenses + insurance + misc expenses + airfares to USA and + reserve cash funds for second year. Generally it will be 15-20 lakhs and sometimes up to 30-35 lakhs depending upon the university expenses.

<p>Liquid funds also covers any Fixed deposits + Bonds + Shares + NSC + Mutual funds + Gold + Jewellery etc. In fact it's better to show Fixed deposits in our opinion. They carry much weight. For everything you intend to show get a latest valuation certificates based on which CA will be giving his certificate.

<p>From bank you need to produce -

<p>A. Bank Letter stating the funds available with sponsors account and how much it will be equivalent in US$.
<br />B. Fixed Deposits Original certificates.
<br />C. 6 months Bank statements and Pass Books and any other related documents.

<p>2. Properties:

<p>There's no uniformity in these issues. Generally it should be around 70-80 lakhs. These may be Buildings, plots, flats, shops, agricultural fields, farm houses etc any immovable property. All these should be evaluated and certified by a CE - Chartered Engineer or Tehsil or concerned metro officials etc to give their certificate of opinion on the value of these immovable assets.

<p>3. CA statement:

<p>A Chartered Accountant will give his certificate of Monetary worthiness of sponsors basing on the documents he is having related to sponsor. His certificate mentions all the Cash, liquid assets and immovable assets available with the sponsor, which can be available for immediate use for the applicants study in USA.

<h3><a name="2"></a>FAQ'S ON F-1 VISA</h3>

<p class="question">Q. Should we carry original documents or photocopies?</p>
A. The applicant should carry the original and one photocopy of all documents.

<p class="question">Q. Do students need any special documents?</p>
A. You must present current documentary evidence that sufficient liquid funds are available from a specifically designated and reliable financial resource to pay all travel, living and school expenses. If the support is from the educational institution in the form of a scholarship or assistantship, it should be noted on the Form I-20. If the support is from a sponsor (normally a very close relative), you must present a notarized Form I-134 Affidavit of Support (available free of charge at any office of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in the USA) stating willingness to finance your education expenses, along with copies of the sponsor's most recent income tax return and bank statements for the past six months. An F-1 applicant must have evidence of sufficient and readily available funds to meet all expenses for the first year of study, and that barring nforeseen circumstances adequate funds will be available for each subsequent year of study. The number of years required to complete the course of study will be determined by the school and noted on the I-20.

<p class="question">Q. Do I have to pay the first year tuition in advance?</p>
A. No. Paying the tuition expenses in advance is one of several ways to show proof of funds, but it is NOT a requirement to pay in advance.

<p class="question">Q. What if the university will not accept the tuition fees in advance?</p>
A. It is the university's decision to accept or not accept the fees in advance. The Consulate has no influence over universities' policies regarding this. Students should consult with prospective universities regarding their policies well in advance of applying for a student visa.

<p class="question">Q. What documents should I show to prove that I can pay for my education?</p>
A. There are no specific documents that prove a student is able to pay for his/her education. Bank account statements, chartered accountant statements, employment letters, and property documents are the most common documents used to show proof of funds.

<p class="question">Q. What if my university does not require that the TOEFL or GRE?</p>
A. Students whose prospective university does not require that they take the TOEFL or GRE should provide a letter from the university stating the same. However, the Consulate recommends that all student visa applicants provide standardized test scores.

<p class="question">Q. Is it required that I apply by Drop Box?</p>
A. Only returning Student applicants may use the drop-box. First time Student visa applicants applying for four-year undergraduate programs or graduate programs leading a master or doctoral degree must make an appointment and be interviewed. Please be aware that after reviewing your case a Consular Officer may require a personal interview before a final decision is made.

<p class="question">Q. How do I prove that I can afford to attend school in the United States?</p>
A. I-20 shows the amount of funding you must have available to cover the first year's expenses. The total amount includes tuition and fees, living expenses, expenses of dependents (if applicable), and other expenses (as applicable). You must prove that you have immediate funds available to cover this amount. If you are going to a two-years Master's program, then you must also show that funds are or will likely be available to cover the same amount for the second year.

<p class="question">Q. What if I have not yet received my degree certificate?</p>
A. Yes - you may still apply, but please be sure to include your mark sheets and provisional certificate if available.

<p class="question">Q. What if I have taken a loan from a bank to cover my tuition?</p>
A. You must prove that funds are immediately available to cover the first year costs, and show evidence that funds will be available for all subsequent years. Any financial documentation you provide should be in support of this. This applies to ALL student visa applicants.

<p class="question">Q. How soon after getting my I-20 may I apply for the visa?</p>
A. You may apply for the visa no earlier than 90 days before the first day of school as indicated on the I-20 form.

<p class="question">Q. What if I have received a full tuition waiver from my prospective university?</p>
A. You must prove that funds are immediately available to cover the first year's costs, and show evidence that funds will be available for all subsequent years. Any financial documentation you provide should be in support of this. This applies to ALL student visa applicants.

<p class="question">Q. Does having a relative in the US affect visa application?</p>
A. No.

<p class="question">Q. What about a foreign sponsor?</p>
A. The motive has to be established clearly. Sixty per cent of the students, who go to the US for education, do so on some sort of aid. Education in the US is a costly proposition. So, if someone is funding you, then the US Consul would want to know why, and under what terms.

<p class="question">Q. For a student visa with sponsorship, is it for or against one's case if the sponsor is (a) a US citizen, (b) an Indian citizen?</p>
A. There is no regulation for or against the nature of citizenship of the sponsor for US visa.

<p class="question">Q. Is there a specific number or quota annually for student visas?</p>
A. There is no ceiling on student visas according to US immigration law.

<p class="question">Q. I am a student going to US for PhD. My I-20 says that my funding is for one year, after which it will be reviewed. Will I have to show funds for the rest of the three-four years of study?</p>
A. At the visa office, the students must show funds (academic plus living) for one year, and access to funds for subsequent years. If your aid covers your overall expenses for the first year, then it is OK.

<p class="question">Q. I get my visa on one I-20; then I get another I-20 from another school, which I now want to join. What will I have to do?</p>
A. You will have to apply for another visa.

<p class="question">Q. How many attempts are allowed if visa is denied?</p>
A. Two attempts in a duration of two years, with a gap of three working days between each attempt. There is also a mail in facility after two attempts where you can mail the US Consulate your documents for review. What has to be kept in mind is that, with each new attempt some fresh documents have to be produced. Visa consuls go by the rules, and if same papers are submitted, then the application hardly stands a chance.

<p class="question">Q. Does the reputation of the college have any bearing on my visa application?</p>
A. No. However, the reputation of the college establishes the motive. If you are going to a reputed college, intentions are clear. But if you are going to an institution no one has heard of, and which has not asked you to take any standard tests, then that makes the US consul suspicious. Though, in some cases, when students are going for some specialist courses, which are not offered anywhere else, a marginal school would do.

<p class="question">Q. If I have been chosen by ten schools, does that help?</p>
A. Yes, it establishes that you are a superstar. There is no direct relation, though it completes the picture for the consul, and helps them evaluate the case better.

<p class="question">Q. What should a student wishing a Graduate (Master's) study in the US do if he is financing his studies himself?</p>
A. He will have to show how he would transfer his funds from India to the US. Does he have a foreign exchange release permit from an authorized bank or a sponsor in the US to take care of his living and education in US dollars? Moreover, he should convince the US Consul that he has strong ties in India, which prove that he is not an intending immigrant.

<p class="question">Q. For students going for further studies, what is considered as conclusive proof that they are coming back? How much assets or liquid cash on hand should be shown for a student visa?</p>
A. There is no fixed amount of assets or liquid cash specified in the US immigration law. The law that operates is that the interviewing US Consul should be convinced that the applicant is a bona fide student, wanting genuinely to pursue higher studies in America and return after his education to India and apply his knowledge in India. The ties that could be shown by students ,would involve his economic attraction in India after graduation and social roots to which he would return rather than stay in the US. Statistics in the past have shown that 7 to 8 out of 10 students do not return and therefore the Consulates in India are very careful in granting student visas.

<p class="question">Q. Is a student visa guaranteed when an I-20 form is issued by a University?</p>
A. A student visa is not guaranteed on the issuance of the I-20 alone as the applicant has to convince the US Consul that he is not an intending immigrant by showing proof of his permanent ties in India.

<p class="question">Q. If sufficient funds are not available, can a loan from banks or other institutions help in getting a student visa?</p>
A. The US Consul will have to be convinced about the mode of repayment of the loan by the applicant. Practically, if loans are shown, then getting a visa becomes difficult.

<p class="question">Q. For a student visa, can a student be partially sponsored by a US-based sponsor and partly by an India-based sponsor?</p>
A. The US Consul has to be convinced about the genuineness of the case. Prima facie, the case cannot be rejected because two sponsors are involved.

<p class="question">Q. Do visas for students get rejected if the applicants have brothers and sisters in America?</p>
A. This is an individual situation. The decision depends on a case-by-case basis. If the US Consul feels that the applicant is trying to get to the US in the guise of a student with possible support of siblings in America, he may be rejected. Likewise, if the applicant's brother or sister had gone to the US on an NonImmigrant Visa and adjusted status to permanent visa, the applicant does become a "risk candidate" and it will be then left to the judgment of the interviewing officer to decide.

<p class="question">Q.What consuls (Visa Officers) look for while issuing a F1-visa (as per www.state.gov)?</p>

<p>A. Evidence of Residence Abroad: The consular officer may not issue a student visa unless satisfied that the applicant: 
(1) has a residence abroad (India), 
(2) has no intention of abandoning that residence, and
(3) intends to depart from the United States upon completion of the course of study.

<p>Applicants generally establish their ties abroad by presenting evidence of economic, social, and/or family ties in their homeland sufficient to induce them to leave the United States upon the completion of studies.

<h3><a name="3"></a>Evidence of English Proficiency</h3>

<p>If the alien's Form I-20 indicates that proficiency in English is required for pursuing the selected course of study and that no arrangements have been made to overcome any English-language deficiency, the consular officer must determine whether the alien has the necessary proficiency. To this end, the officer must conduct the visa interview in English and may require the applicant to read aloud from an English-language book, periodical, or newspaper, and to restate in English in the applicant's own words what was read. The applicant may also be asked to read aloud and explain several of the conditions set forth in the Form I-20.

<p>In the event that the applicant's language proficiency appears marginal, the officer may refer the applicant for language testing. Tests for this purpose will ordinarily be carried out by appropriate local groups, such as qualified host-country facilities. If the latter are used, the consular officer should be satisfied that the testing standards are sufficiently strict. However, if the local situation requires the consular officer to determine the language proficiency of applicants, materials such as the Test of English Language Proficiency (TEPL) may be available at the post. If not, they may be requested from the Department, through the post's Public Affairs Officer.

<h3>Determining Financial Status of F-1 Students</h3>

<p>The phrase "sufficient funds to cover expenses" referred to in 41.61(b)(2) REGS/STATS means the applicant must establish the unlikelihood of either becoming a public charge as defined in INA 212(a)(4) or of resorting to unauthorized U.S. employment for financial support. An applicant must provide documentary evidence that sufficient funds are, or will be, available to defray all expenses during the entire period of anticipated study. This does not mean that the applicant must have cash immediately available to cover the entire period of intended study, which may last several years. The consular officer must, however, require credible documentary evidence that the applicant has enough readily available funds to meet all expenses for the first year of study. The officer also must be satisfied that, barring unforeseen circumstances, adequate funds will be available for each subsequent year of study from the same source or from one or more other specifically identified and reliable financial sources.

<h3>Funds From Source(s) Outside the United States</h3>

<p>Whenever an applicant indicates financial support from a source outside the United States (for example, from parents living in the country of origin), the consular officer must determine whether there are restrictions on the transfer of funds from the country concerned. If so, the consular officer must require acceptable evidence that these restrictions will not prevent the funds from being made available during the period of the applicant's projected stay in the United States.

<h3>Affidavits of Support or Other Assurances by an Interested Party</h3>

<p>Various factors are important in evaluating assurances of financial support by interested parties:
Financial support to a student is not a mere formality to facilitate the applicant's entry into the United States, nor does it pertain only when the alien cannot otherwise provide adequate personal support. Rather, the sponsor must ensure that the applicant will not become a public charge or be compelled to take unauthorized employment while studying in the United States. This obligation commences when the alien enters the United States and continues until the alien's departure.

<p>The consular officer must require documentary evidence to resolve any doubt that the financial status of the person giving the assurance is sufficient to substantiate the assertion that financial support is available to the applicant.

<p>If the person giving the assurance is in the United States in nonimmigrant status, the consular officer must examine the evidence presented with exceptional care. Is the sponsor's financial situation sufficient to provide the funds without need to resort to unauthorized employment? Is it likely to worsen during the period of thecommitment, possibly compelling the applicant or the sponsor to resort to unauthorized employment? Will the nonimmigrant sponsor remain in the United States at least as long as the student?

<p>The consular officer must also carefully evaluate the factors, which would motivate a sponsor to honor a commitment of financial support. If the sponsor is a close relative of the applicant, there may be a greater probability that the commitment will be honored than if the sponsor is not a relative. Regardless of the relationship, the consular officer must be satisfied that the reasons prompting the offer of financial support make it likely the commitment will be fulfilled.

<h3>Funds From Fellowships and Scholarships for F-1 Student</h3>

<p>A college or university may arrange for a nonimmigrant student to engage in research projects, give lectures, or perform other academic functions as part of a fellowship, scholarship or assistantship grant, provided the institution certifies that the student will also pursue a full course of study.

<h3>Educational Qualifications for F-1 Students</h3>

<p>Consular officers are not expected to assume the role of guidance counselor to determine whether an applicant for an F-1 visa is qualified to pursue the desired course of study. The institution will satisfy itself on the student's abilities before accepting the applicant for enrollment. Consular officers should, however, be alert to three specific factors in this regard:

<p>(1) the applicant has successfully completed a course of study equivalent to that normally required of an American student seeking enrollment at the same level.

<p>(2) cases in which an applicant has submitted forged or altered transcripts of previous or related study or training which the institution has accepted as valid

<h3>Few Visa interview tips:</h3>

<p>For students with full financial aid visa is not a problem usually. Follow these tips to make your visa experience more peaceful.

<p>Try and gather information on the current trend, what the visa officer is expecting, why visa is being rejected, etc. Join a yahoogroup formed for discussing visa issues. Look for decisions and experiences particularly in the consulate where you woll be appearing for the interview. Knowing what to expect helps!

<p>When you go for the visa dress well. Speak slowly and clearly. Don't appear tense and don't look desperate. Showing self-confidence helps.

<p>Go along with a friend having a vehicle (just in case you have to go & get something)

<p>They should never feel that you will have any sort of difficulty 
- language, finance, racial, religious, etc.

<p>You should be able to convince them that you will come back to India. If they ask you, points in favor are :

<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> only child, </li>
<li> immovable property in India (can take a proof document), </li>
<li> orthodox family, </li>
<li> brought up in rural atmosphere, </li>
<li> lots of relatives in India; none abroad, </li>
<li> mom, dad won't come to USA, </li>
